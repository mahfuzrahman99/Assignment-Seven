**Features**:

1. **Course Selection**: The website allows users to choose their desired courses by clicking the "Select" button on each course card. This feature enables users to build their course list easily.

2. **Credit Hours Limit**: To ensure efficient course planning, users are limited to adding courses with a combined credit hour total of up to 20 hours. If the total exceeds this limit, a popup message will alert users, helping them manage their selections within the allowed credit hours.

3. **Duplicate Course Prevention**: The system prevents users from accidentally adding the same course multiple times. If a user attempts to add a course they've already selected, a popup message will inform them about the duplication and guide them on how to proceed correctly.

**State Management**:

To clarify the concept of state, in the context of your project, it refers to a function or a specialized system, often referred to as a "hook" in React or any JavaScript program. This system comprises two key components: a variable (state) and a function that can modify the value of that variable.

Here's how you've effectively implemented state management in your project:

1. **Data Storage**: You've harnessed state to store data retrieved from a JSON file or an API server, ensuring efficient data handling and manipulation.

2. **Total Price and Total Credits**: Through state, you've kept track of important metrics such as the total price of selected courses and the cumulative credit hours. This helps users have a clear overview of their course choices.

3. **Selected Courses**: State management plays a crucial role in maintaining a record of the courses users have selected. This data is then seamlessly displayed in the user interface, providing transparency and ease of use.

I hope these modifications offer a more detailed and comprehensive explanation of your website's features and state management approach.
